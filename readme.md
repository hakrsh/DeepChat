# DeepChat

DeepChat is a simple command-line chatbot powered by OpenAI, providing real-time Q&A with a user-friendly interface following Material Design guidelines.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to generate an OpenAI API key and store it in your environment variables as `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can do this by following the instructions on the OpenAI website.

You'll also need to create a virtual environment and install the required packages. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the chatbot
